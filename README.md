--------------------------------

Values are in the following order :
 * width
 * height (with the width you can calculate the number of pixel)
 * number of detected pixel (the paper)
 * difference of detected pixel between 2 pictures
 * x position of the center of the paper
 * y position of the center of the paper
 * x movement of the center of the paper
 * y movement of the center of the paper

Data could be normalized with the width and the height
